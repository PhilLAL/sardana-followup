# Sardana and Taurus Workshop 2018

As in some previous occasions we take a profit of the annual Tango 
meetings and organize a satellite Sardana and Taurus workshop. This time the 
workshop will be held in parallel to the Tango Steering Committee meeting.

Since the available time is very limited we do not foresee to introduce 
Sardana and Taurus to the newcomers but will directly start with the 
overview of the newest features/issues. 

More information about the venue can be found on the 32nd Tango 
Collaboration Meeting [site](https://indico.eli-beams.eu/event/310/page/0)

If you need any information, please contact:
Zbigniew Reszela (zreszela@cells.es) or Carlos Pascual (cpascual@cells.es)
